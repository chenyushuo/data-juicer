    "# Data-Juicer Intermediate Dataset Format for Multimodal Datasets\n",
    "\n",
    "Due to large format diversity among different multimodal datasets and works, Data-Juicer propose a novel intermediate text-based interleaved data format for multimodal dataset, which is based on chunk-wise formats such MMC4 dataset.\n",
    "\n",
    "In the Data-Juicer format, a multimodal sample or document is based on a text, which consists of several text chunks. Each chunk is a semantic unit, and all the multimodal information in a chunk should talk about the same thing and be aligned with each other.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here is a multimodal sample example in Data-Juicer format below.\n",
    "\n",
    "- It includes 4 chunks split by the special token `<|__dj__eoc|>`.\n",
    "- In addition to texts, there are 3 other modalities: images, audios, videos. They are stored on the disk and their paths are listed in the corresponding first-level fields in the sample.\n",
    "- Other modalities are represented as special tokens in the text (e.g. image -- `<__dj__image>`). The special tokens of each modality correspond to the paths in the order of appearance. (e.g. the two image tokens in the third chunk are images of antarctica_map and europe_map respectively)\n",
    "- There could be multiple types of modalities and multiple modality special tokens in a single chunk, and they are semantically aligned with each other and text in this chunk. The position of special tokens can be random in a chunk. (In general, they are usually before or after the text.)\n",
    "- For multimodal samples, unlike text-only samples, the computed stats for other modalities could be a list of stats for the list of multimodal data (e.g. image_widths in this sample).\n",
